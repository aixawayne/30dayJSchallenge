    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //si no le pasas parametros, te hace una copia del array original


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
     const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.numer = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
